# CapitalCityChallenge
Test your geography knowledge!

## Changes
This is an update of the CapitalCityChallenge game I built in 2018. This time around I decided to use the requests library to pull in data on cities from a RESTAPI instead of hardcoding data. Therefore if answers are weird, blame the API!
