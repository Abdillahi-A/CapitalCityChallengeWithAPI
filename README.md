# CapitalCityChallenge
Test your geography knowledge!


## Motivation:

In 2018 I started self-learning Python. I enrolled onto various courses on Udemy and Coursera. As great as each of these courses were, I was always left with an existensial feeling of "what now?" after completing them. Yes, I learned the difference between a tuple and a list, what a forloop and while loop are and how to write functions. But so what ? What can I do with all of this new information ? To their credit, these courses would often suggested doing a final project like building a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, to bring all of these concepts together. But I wasn't interested in Tic-Tac-Toe. So instead I started this project, combining my love for geography and capital cities with python.

## Notes:

This initial proejct used the requests library to pull in data on cities from a RESTAPI instead of hardcoding data. However, after revisiting the project in 2023 I realised that API was no longer free. Thus, my code was broken. As such, I recently re-factored it using a different API, but this time hardcoding the data from the API into my own dataset. The continents.py file does this hardcoding and has already been run for you, with the outputs being placed in the data.json file.

## Requirements:
`pip install fuzzywuzzy`
